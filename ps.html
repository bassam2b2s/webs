		<h2>Web Development:_</h2>

		<br>
		<br>

<p>

 Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make <br> a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.
        <br>
        <br>
 Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of <br> tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.
        <br>
        <br>
 Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option.
        <br>
        <br> 
 It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.
        <br>
        <br>
 The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side).<br> Let’s delve into the details.

		<h2>App Development:_</h2>

        <br>

		<p>
Application development is the process of creating a computer program or a set of programs to perform the different tasks<br>that a business requires.
        <br>
        <br>
From calculating monthly expenses to scheduling sales reports, applications help businesses<br> automate processes and increase efficiency.
        <br>
        <br> 
Every app-building process follows the same steps: gathering requirements<br> designing prototypes, testing, implementation, and integration.

		<h2>Graphic Design:_</h2>

         <br>

<p>

 Graphic design is the process of visual communication through the use of typography, photography, iconography <br>and illustration.
         <br>
         <br>
 The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but  sometimes<br> the term "graphic design" is used synonymously.<br><br> Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text<br> to form visual representations of ideas and messages.
         <br>
         <br>
  They use typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. 
         <br>
         <br>
 Common applications of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design<br> (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design,<br> product packaging, and signage.

		<h2>Machine Learning:_</h2>

         <hr>

<p>
 Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
<br>
<br> 
 It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.
<br>
<br>
  Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions<br> or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
 <br>
 <br>
  Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email  filtering and computer vision,<br> where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
 <br>
 <br>
 A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using<br> computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning.
<br>
<br>
  The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.
 <br>
 <br>
   Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.
